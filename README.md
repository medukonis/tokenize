# tokenize 
# written in c
# tokenize will take a variable size char array and perform word tokenization meaning it will strip out extra spaces and anything other
# A-Z and a-z.  This was written specific for another project (disaster damage description and construction estimating) and still needs 
# additional features. The ability to deal with numbers (0-9) would be a "nice to have" but not necessary.
